# Quick Charts

A QtQuick module providing high-performance charts.

## Introduction

The Quick Charts module provides a set of charts that can be used from QtQuick
applications. They are intended to be used for both simple display of data as
well as continuous display of high-volume data.

## Concepts

There are three main concepts to consider when using this module: charts, data
sources and decorations.

### Charts

These are the main items of the module. They process data and render it in a
certain way. Currently there are three main types of charts: Pie Charts, Line
Charts and Bar Charts.

### Data Sources

Data sources are objects that provide data to charts.

### Decorations

Decorations are items that provide extra information about a chart. These are
things like a legend or axis labels.

## Controls

A submodule is provided that contains pre-made controls that are provided as a
convenience layer. These controls may be more restrictive in their data sources
or how they display things.
